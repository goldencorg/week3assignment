    <!--I made one big container with a row inside. I made three main divs (text, empty, image/table) that take up different amounts of columns. 
    They take up 6,1, and 5 columns respectively. I used classes that will stack the divs once they reach the minumum size requirement of less than
    1200 pixels of width. I created a figure with a caption and then a table below that will all stack under the main text when the screen size decreases.-->

            Hello! I'm Nathan. This website is based on my career as Offensive Coordinator of the Cal Golden Bears in the Dynasty mode of the game College Football 25.
            My goal was to bring this 3.5 star program back to glory. I am currently in season 4, year 2027 of this career save, coming off a dominant run from the previous season. 
            On this site, I have displayed my most important players on offense, while also including valuable pieces from the defensive side.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            I bought CFB 25 out of curiosity, interested in how it would compare with Madden games. It led me to gain a much better understanding of college football and even become a big fan of it.
            Now I follow it every week and can't get enough of it, while slowly learning more about the strategical and analytical aspects of football. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            While the Golden Bears will have my support in real life, due to being their OC in CFB 25, I will always support the USC Trojans above everyone else. Fight on!
          </p>
